Create a simple program for solar system objects information with following capabilities:
1. The information about solar system object must include
   - name;
   - object type (planet, moon, dwarf planet, star, etc.);
   - orbital period;
   - a list of moons.
2. Solar system objects can have the same name, as long as they are of different type;
3. Only moons (object type) can be added as planet satellites;
4. There must be an option to sort seats by price.



Test cases:
1. Attempting to add a duplicate to a Set must result in no change to the set (so the original value is not replaced by the new one).
2. Attempting to add a duplicate to a Map results in the original being replaced by the new object.
3. Two bodies with the same name but different designations can be added to the same set.
4. Two bodies with the same name but different designations can be added to the same map, and can be retrieved from the map.
